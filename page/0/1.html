<p>Who are you?</p>

<p>You have been known to perform music. Your style might be described as "eclectic". The ukulele is your weapon of choice, though you dabble in vocals and other instruments. You've played under several alter egos; Theremis, Houdinia, Princess Bloodthorne, and others besides. While on stage, you enjoy costuming and playing the role of a character that isn't yourself. For some reason, it helps calm your nerves.</p>

<p>You're a bit of an amateur gardener, and enjoy tending to plants as a way to distract yourself and relax. You've got a passing interest in herbal medicine, and use your own produce or whatever ingredients are available in your freestyle cooking. Once upon a time, you were an aspiring freerunner and gymnast. Then you got lazy. You aren't as coordinated as you used to be, but you still know a few tricks.</p>

<p>Truth be told, you are a rather anxious person, with a number of inconvenient fears. You avoid swimming for fear of drowning. You feel a bit of social anxiety among large crowds, and performing on stage isn't much different. You've learned to trick yourself out of those feelings by replacing them with irrational overconfidence. This helps, but the habit has lead you into a lot of impulsive decisions, and general risk-taking. You're pretty good at concealing and controlling your emotions, but sometimes you worry that you're a little too good at lying to yourself.</p>
