<p>You stand up from your seat on the floor. As you rise, your feet wobble under you, and your head swims a bit. You manage to keep yourself from falling, though.</p>

<p>Seems you're in a well-lit cave. It's surprisingly warm and dry. From what you know of subterranean places, that's a little unusual. As you look around, you see an equally strange Stray Ukulele. Maybe it's yours? You certainly played one before, but you're not sure this was it.</p>

<p><q>Something</q> about it feels...</p>

<img class="w288" src="image/0/2_garble.png">

<p>As you try to remember the Uke you used to play, <q>your head starts to feel really strange</q>. The <q>thoughts start to shift and blur</q>, until the ideas don't make proper sense anymore. It's like the memory becomes sounds and smells, or reasons and feelings, or something else. The whole Train of Thought just <q>melts into mushy nonsense</q>, until you can't hold it anymore.</p>

<p>Then there goes the Caboose of Thought, evaporating into nothing. Like the details of a dream, after you wake up. Or a train that's real shitty at existing.</p>

<p>No, scratch that last one. First one was better.</p>

<img class="w256" src="image/item/ukulele.png">

<p>Anyway, whether or not the Stray Ukulele is yours, it's all alone here. It's a little scuffed and travel-worn, but it's in good condition. And there's no one else to take care of it, right?</p>

<p>You decide to take it with you. It might need a name, though.</p>

<p>Uke secure, you head over to a large, bright opening in the cave wall. At first, you thought it might be a window, but it's big enough to walk through. The bright sunlight makes it hard to see the details without stepping outside. However, there's a trail of some sort, winding between two rocky hills.</p>

<p>You're thinking it's more of a doorway. Perhaps the Cave Entrance?</p>

<p>What, this big thing? Obviously, that's a Duffel Bag. Though, like the Ukulele, you don't recognize it either. You head starts to feel <q>all fuzzy again</q> when you try.</p>

<p>It's probably pretty heavy, judging by the size. You'd rather not carry it around until you're ready to move on. Still, you're kinda curious about what's inside. Unless there's anything else you really wanted to do here, maybe...</p>

<p>Well, okay. You can drop the song idea. Maybe this situation calls for a hug, instead? I mean, there's no one here, but there's...</p>

<p>Okay sure whatever. Forget your troubles. Replace them with kittens. That works.</p>

<p>And hey! Unlike normal kittens, Brain Kittens don't have to eat or poop! That's great! So you're just gonna put this next idea on hold. Then you can summon some Brain Kittens right up, and...</p>
