Hana and friend planned to cross to leave Lucity, which is a totalitarian false-utopia world. Don't know where they're going (it was a stupid risk).

Eidola are composed of White Matter. This burns up in the material world, without mental energy to sustain it. Shards, which are memories, allow them to exist by consuming the "physical" stuff of it, to stay alive and retain their own memories by destroying others.

Shards must be sustained. Not sure by what.

A group has found a way to sustain shards.
